As of v666, MetaDoom now properly supports having custom levels for it. Having
made one of the few mods that really got custom maps for it in Reelism, I really
hope people enjoy messing around with this weird smushed up setting and take
advantage of all the monsters and weapons I've assembled over the past four years
or so to create some really kickass new maps.

Some things to keep in mind:

MONSTERS, PROPS AND SUCH
------------------------
The vanilla actor placements act the same as they do when MetaDoom is loaded as
a gameplay mod, which is to say that they randomize or may not be replaced,
depending on game progress and/or CVars. The various folders in the Edit Thing
window in Ultimate Doom Builder now have "MetaDoom" subfolders that allow you to
place specific MetaDoom actors without being subject to randomization etc,
allowing you to create gameplay scenarios and encounters with specific weapons
and monsters in mind.

TREASURE AND LORE ITEMS
-----------------------
Loot and Lore Items can be found at the bottom of the Edit Thing listing in the
"MetaDoom Loot" and "MetaDoom Lore Items" folders. If you want to have complete
control of how such items are placed (and you probably do so you can create cool
appealing secrets!) place actor 30000 somewhere in the level. (You can find this
in the Edit Thing window in the "Editor Things" folder, under the name of
"This Is A MetaDoom Map!"). This will stop automatic placement of such items,
allowing you to place them manually and completely control how they're found...

NEW ACTORS
----------
The following actors will not spawn as part of MetaDoom's usual gameplay moddery
and are provided exclusively for custom levels. You can find them at the bottom
of the Edit Thing list.

BURNING FLAMES: These block the player from going through them and burn them if
they're dumb enough to touch them. Flames can only be removed using the oft-ignored
Fire Extinguisher weapon, giving it a fresh purpose.

ITEM BOX: Drops some random loot when shot. More importantly, can drop other stuff
if the mapper specifies as such. Should function in this regard in the same way
as the Hexen Pottery, but you'll probably want to spawn a specific actor without
arsing around with spawnids, so be sure to tick the "String" box on the argument.

GRAPPLE TARGET: These invulnerable, non-solid objects can be latched onto with
the SSG's Meathook. When the player passes near them their Meathook cooldown
will be refilled and their gravity will be disabled for half a second,
potentially making chains of hooks from A to B fairer.

THEMING
-------
MetaDoom is a mod that mashes together all of the different Doom games, so a
good MetaDoom map will take the same sort of attitute. Try messing around with
blending Doom 1 and Doom 3 visual elements together, or try mashing in Doom 64's
lighting or environmental-alteration scripting tricks! Bonus points for sneaking
in all sorts of deep cuts to obscure bits of Doom history, like the prototypes
or, heck, even one of the movies...

FINALY...
---------
Have fun! If you make a MetaDoom level, don't hestitate to post it on the ZDoom
Forums (https://forum.zdoom.org/) and/or tweet at me about it @kinsie.

Rip and Tear!
