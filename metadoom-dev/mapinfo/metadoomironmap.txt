// Gross workaround for Ironman Cluster Stuffs:
// Attempting to warp the player to a different cluster results in a story text
// screen popping up. To work around this, we have a duplicate of the Ironman
// death map defined for many possible cluster numbers and use ACS to send the
// player to the right one. This should cover everything in WadSmoosh...
