        name "Hand Grenade";
        origin "Doom 3 (2004)";
        description "A common sight on the battlefields of the past, the Hand Grenade hasn't changed a lot on the surface, beyond the old-fashioned safety pin being replaced with a convenient twist-and-pull design. Under the hood, however, there's been a surprising amount of work over the decades to reduce 'drop spots' and generally increase the range and damage as much as possible without increasing size or weight.\n\nYou throw it. It bounces around a bit. It explodes. There are no special capabilities. Were you expecting any...?";

	entry "TeslaRocket"
    {
		itemToCheck "TeslaRocket";
        name "Tesla Rocket";
        origin "Doom (2016)";
        description "A recent innovation in defensive equipment, the Tesla Rocket is hand-activated by the user, like a Grenade, as opposed to being launched from a weapon. Upon activation, the Tesla Rocket slowly flies forward, arcs of electricity bouncing off and damaging nearby enemies. Upon hitting a solid obstacle, the Tesla Rocket explodes with a concussive electrical blast.\n\nIt's expected that these will become standard-issue in the near future, provided no demonic invasions interrupt testing. But what are the odds of that?";

		itemToCheck "SiphonGrenade";
        name "Siphon Grenade";
        origin "Doom (2016)";
        description "An experimental fusion of time-honored Grenades with state-of-the-art nanotechnology, the Siphon Grenade releases a particle field that violently attracts Argent plasma from any nearby sources (including Demons) and transfers it to the Argent Receptors in the thrower's armor, which then converts it into healing materials. This uniquely vampiric weapon provides a safe method of sucking the life from your opponents without exposing yourself to harm.\n\nThe Siphon Grenade activates on impact. Don't worry about distance: you're immune to the ''blast''.";

	entry "ShieldWall"
    {
		itemToCheck "ShieldWall";
        name "Shield Wall";
        origin "Doom (2016)";
        description "The next evolution in barrier technology, the Shield Wall is a portable plasma projector that temporarily generates a solid light barrier that blocks nearly anything (other than the operator's own attacks!) for a brief period of time. This is useful for providing a respite from enemy attacks, but be warned - it's not strong enough to block beams of energy like the Hell Razer's.\n\nThe Hologram activates on impact with the ground. The shield lasts a little over seven seconds before its batteries expire.";

    {
		itemToCheck "DogCollar";
        name "Dog Collar";
        origin "Doom RPG (2005)";
        description "A small fabric collar with some strange runes stitched around it. These devices are used on Earth so that pet owners can lead their domesticated fur-babies around without being within biting distance. Who knew that it also worked on flesh eating canines from the fiery pits?\n\nActivate to launch the collar out. It won't do any damage, but if it hits a Hellhound class enemy, you will claim that dog as a meatshield/melee weapon! Press Fire to bite the hell out of enemies. Press Alternate Fire or switch away to hurl it at enemies.";

	entry "Hologram"
    {
		itemToCheck "Hologram";
        name "Hologram";
        origin "Doom (2016)";
        description "Once predicted by sci-fi movies and lowbrow 3D action games of the 20th century, the Hologram provides a unique take on crowd control. Upon activation, it generates a refracted-light hologram of a photo-realistic 3D render of the operator, typically doing something insulting. This infuriates nearby demons, who will attempt to attack it and fail miserably, often hurting each other and triggering a hailstorm of infighting in the process.\n\nThe Hologram activates on impact with the ground. You might want to run away shortly after it activates...";

	entry "KineticMine"
    {
		itemToCheck "KineticMine";
        name "Kinetic Mine";
        origin "Doom DLC 1: Unto the Evil (2016)";
        description "An experiment in automated defense mechanisms, the Kinetic Mine attaches to whatever solid surface it hits using powerful steel claws before activating a 360-degree array of sensors to observe its surroundings. Once an enemy enters range, the mine arms a powerful explosive before physically launching itself at the target, saving them the trouble of stepping on it.\n\nThe Kinetic Mine activates upon hitting a surface, detaches once its batteries expire, and is extremely illegal on Earth... but as mankind travels through the stars, international treaties have yet to catch up.";

        name "The Artifact";
        origin "Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil (2005)";
        description "A curious device seemingly created by the demonic invaders, the Artifact resembles a large organic heart withered and corrupted by the powers within. Upon activation, the Artifact unleashes a burst of demonic energy that gives the bearer supernatural reflexes, making it feel a lot like time has slowed down around them and giving them a brief period of free reign with which to wreak havoc.\n\nEach burst of the Artifact lasts roughly five seconds, and leaves the user feeling a little... hollower. Almost as if it's taking something from them in return for its ''services''...";

        origin "Doom (1993)";
        description "This hardened military backpack is designed to allow members of the UAC's Rapid Response Tactical Squad to comfortably carry large amounts of equipment necessary for their role through the extreme conditions often present on the Martian surface.\n\nAs an emergency-preparedness measure, the RRTS have hidden several backpacks within secure locations around UAC facilities, packed with ammunition and a bottle of distilled water. Extra room is left for more ammo, should it be necessary. (It will be.)";

        origin "Doom 3 (2004)";
        description "Versatile and lightweight, the PDA has quickly become standard-issue among all UAC personnel, providing them with a wealth of information no matter where they might be. Wireless internet and GPS connectivity provides automatic mapping of the nearby environment, which can be saved for future reference on the device's whopping 100mb of storage.\n\nThe device's popularity has led to a surge of third party app development, including games. One recent release, ''Evil Unleashed'' has faced some criticism over its low-res, blocky depictions of violence.";

        origin "Doom (1993)";
        description "The next step from the Hazmat Suits of the 20th Century, the Radiation Suit is equipped fully sealed with a self-contained breathing apparatus and a thick multi-layer material that protects the user from all manner of environmental hazards, be they radioactive waste, boiling fluids or unfathomable dark forces.\n\nThe limited oxygen supply, however, restricts its use to brief, 60-second intervals. Additional R&D for larger, lighter oxygen tanks is sorely needed, but funding has been difficult to attain due to budget overruns in the teleporter research program...";

        name "Berserk Pack";
        origin "Doom (1993)";
        description "The 'Berserk' serum is the nickname given to an experimental drug developed by UAC scientists. It was initially developed to strengthen the user's immune system to fend off infections, but tests resulted in the drug heightening the patients' bloodthirst and capacity for violence.\n\nThe UAC steered the project in a new direction, resulting in a serum that would enhance the prowess of soldiers during battle.\n\nA single dosage lasts 60 seconds, and usually ends with the patient staring in horror at their blood soaked hands.";

        name "Light Amp Visor";
        origin "Doom (1993)";
        description "The evolution of optoelectronic devices has been subtle and understated since the early 21st Century, leading some sceptics to cast the technology as one of those stand-still dead-ends like radio.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's useless though - this headset might be bulky, and the viewport might be garish, but it'll dramatically increase the visibility of living (or unliving) creatures in even the darkest depths.\n\nCurrent models have a two minute battery before you're left in the dark.";

        name "Haste Sphere";
        origin "Quake 3 Arena (1999)";
        description "An ominous red orb full of malicious spirits - upon being freed by a wayward traveller, they will possess the user's limbs, forcing them to sprint wildly into danger, whether they want to be there or not.\n\nSuch furious cardiovascular activity typically results in myocardial rupture (or, in English: your heart explodes).\n\nNever before have you been more scared of having ghosts in your pants.\n\nThe spirits will typically dissipate into the ether after 45 seconds of aid and/or harassment.";

        origin "Doom (1993)";
        description "This sinister green orb contains an as-yet-unidentified fluid-like substance that, upon shattering, immediately and completely coats the nearest individual with a thin, glowing golden shell.\n\nWhile this shell quickly dissipates, it appears to be completely impregnable by any force man or beast has devised. Somewhat concerning, however, is that test subjects have no memory of their actions while under its influence...\n\nThe shell disintegrates into a fetid mist after 30 seconds of golden amnesic immortality, leaving nothing but awkward questions in its wake.";

        origin "Quake (1996)";
        description "This strange orb seems to be full of human nanomachine technology from some unidentified source. Is this some kind of military skunkworks project to recreate the demon power spheres?\n\nThe only thing that isn't a mystery is its effect - the nanomachines rapidly cling onto the user's weapons and greatly increases their effectiveness for a brief period of time.\n\nThe nanomachines only last 60 seconds before they burn out, potentially doing permanent damage to the weapons' inner workings. This is NOT covered under warranty, before you ask.";
